"""
shows user the matching images from the dataset. Flags for removal with user permission.

 uses the same image matching program as the program to find matching images in the dataset. If you took video, there
 will be dozens of frames saved at every location, and you just donâ€™t need to have that many images in the database.

 This program displays two images. If they match, press y to record the number of the matching image in a txt file.
 Press any other key to advance.

 NOTE this program assumes that the first image in a series of matching images is the
 best one, but that is often not the case since the camera image gets very blurry during turning. We found it easiest
 to have pen and paper nearby either while doing this or just after and recording blurry image numbers while passing over
 them during deletion. You can then add your list of blurry images to the list of matches compiled by this program and
 delete them all at once.
