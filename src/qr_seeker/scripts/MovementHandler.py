MovementHandler.py

Created: June, 2016

This file borrows some ideas from the FixedActions.py in Speedy_nav. This file
handles the actions the turtlebot completes to see the image it is looking
for in the center of its view. It reacts differently depending on which
camera the bot is seeing out of.
